# BD-Chitter-Theme
A Theme for betterDiscord vaguely based on Chitter from Homestuck

This theme is best used with a plugin that changes message colours, like [BetterRoleColors](https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/BetterRoleColors) or [plrualChum](https://github.com/estroBiologist/pluralchum).
Download the css file and add it into your betterDiscord themes folder, which can be opened from the betterDiscord themes menu.

(If you want to use both BetterRoleColours and Pluralchum, I've found enabling both (As well as Zere's Libary) then killing discord using the task manager and reopening it, I've found that resolve any conflicts that might happen)
